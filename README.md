- `npm run serve` - Locally serve a production build
- `npm start` - alias to the `develop` task

### Guides
These are some guides related to configuring different parts of this application to customize it for your needs.

#### Setting Up (API) Proxies
In _webpack.config.develop.js_ and _lws.config.js_ are sections for setting up proxies for routing requests, say to an API running in your development envrionment.  Edit the placeholders to match your particular needs.
