# my-app
This is your brand new evergreen app!  Welcome!

## Development
Automated tasks have been made available as **npm** scripts that you can run from the command line using `yarn` or `npm run`:
- `develop` - To start a development server with live reload and file watching
- `build` - Generate a production build of the app for deployment
- `serve` - Locally serve a production build
- `test` - Run unit tests in TDD mode (prepend with `NODE_ENV=production` for "single run" usage)
- `start` - alias to the `develop` task

e.g. to start developing, run
```shell
# yarn
$ yarn develop

or

# npm
$ npm run develop
```
